* kaleidoscope-LLVM8
This project aims to make [[https://github.com/sdiehl/kaleidoscope][sdiehl's kaledioscope project]] compatible
with the LLVM8 bindings for Haskell.

Hopefully in the future this will be the case for LLVM9 as well

All of the tutorial is implemented. Once the project fully works, we
will hopefully create a PR for [[https://github.com/llvm-hs/llvm-hs-kaleidoscope][the LLVM version which supports only
LLVM 5.0]]
** Issues
- Currently with optimization pass enabled, external functions are
  optimized out
