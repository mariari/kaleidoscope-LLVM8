* kaleidoscope-LLVM8
This project aims to make [[https://github.com/sdiehl/kaleidoscope][sdiehl's kaledioscope project]] compatible
with the LLVM8 bindings for Haskell.

Hopefully in the future this will be the case for LLVM9 as well

Currently only up to chapter 6 is implemented, however once the
project is complete, we will hopefully create a PR for [[https://github.com/llvm-hs/llvm-hs-kaleidoscope][the LLVM
version which supports only LLVM 5.0]]
** Issues
- Currently with optimization pass enabled, external functions are
  optimized out
